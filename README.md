# Using Natural Language Processing to Analyze Yelp Reviews

Yelp provides a crowd-sourced review forum for businesses and services. People share their reviews and rate businesses and services. Other users can also rate other people's reviews.

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict whether customers are satisfied or not based on the reviews they have written.

My personal learning objective from this project is to explore the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP), apply feature extraction using Count Vectorizers and understand the theory behind Naive Bayes classifiers.
